    <p><h2>Club Rules and Etiquette</h2>
    Shodokan Aikido is a Japanese martial art and as such practitioners are expected to adhere to certain rules that are focused on respect. Respect is paramount. As such Dojos which are regarded and treated as a sacred place are treated with tremendous respect. This is why we kneel and bow when both entering and exiting the mattes. It is also the reason why we sweep the mattes post-practise. 
<br><br>
There are many rules and social expectations that are expected from practitioners but fear not as we understand new members are unaware of these and are here to help. Our focus is to help members grow and improve.

<br><br>
For me (Rory Daniels) there was no better way to accustom myself to Japanese culture and society than through my martial arts experience. I implore non-Japanese natives to try a Japanese martial art to better their understanding of Japanese society.

<br><br>
<h2>Taboos you should be aware of:</h2>
<br>Wearing shoes on the mattes. 
<br>Throwing or dropping weapons.
<br>Drinking and eating on mattes.
<br>Wearing hats on mattes.

<br><br>
<div class="red">For the duration of the SARS-COVID-19 pandemic we would like to ask practitioners to wear face masks when training with another person. Of course removing masks when socially distanced to rest is fine.
